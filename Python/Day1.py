# Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

# Expected Output:

# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')

# Answer:

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print( "The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

                           # String Manipulation

print("Hello World! \nHello world! ") # \n used to print the word 2 times without using print 2 times

# Concatenate

print("Hello" + "Ayyappan") # there is space between hello and ayyappan

# adding space in 3 ways
print("Hello" + " Ayyappan")  # or
print("Hello " + "Ayyappan")  # or
print("Hello" + " " + "Ayyappan")

#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Answer: 

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")  # " is missing
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.') # use single quote to avoid error
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")') # avoid space at beginning (indentation error)
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.") # remove ( at first.
